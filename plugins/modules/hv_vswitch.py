short_description: Manage Hyper-V Virtual Switches and extensions
description:
  - Create, manage, and remove Hyper-V Virtual Switches.
  - Supports External, Internal, and Private switch types.
  - Manage Virtual Switch Extensions (Enable/Disable).
  - Configure advanced properties like bandwidth mode, IOV, and teaming.
options:
  name:
    description:
      - The name of the virtual switch.
    type: str
    required: true
  state:
    description:
      - The desired state of the virtual switch.
    type: str
    choices: [ present, absent ]
    default: present
  switch_type:
    description:
      - The type of virtual switch to create.
      - Required when creating a new switch.
      - External switches require C(net_adapter_names).
    type: str
    choices: [ external, internal, private ]
  net_adapter_names:
    description:
      - A list of physical network adapter names to bind to an external switch.
      - Required when C(switch_type=external).
      - Adapter names are resolved to their interface descriptions when checking
        or changing an existing external switch.
      - Changing an existing switch to multiple adapters is not supported; recreate
        the switch with C(state=absent) followed by C(state=present) instead.
    type: list
    elements: str
  allow_management_os:
    description:
      - Whether the parent OS has access to the physical adapter.
      - Only valid for External switches.
    type: bool
  enable_embedded_teaming:
    description:
      - Whether to enable Switch Embedded Teaming (SET).
      - Only valid for External switches.
      - This setting can only be configured when the switch is created.
      - Recreate the switch with C(state=absent) followed by C(state=present) to
        change this setting.
    type: bool
  enable_iov:
    description:
      - Whether to enable single-root I/O virtualization (SR-IOV) on the switch.
      - This setting can only be configured when the switch is created.
      - Recreate the switch with C(state=absent) followed by C(state=present) to
        change this setting.
    type: bool
  minimum_bandwidth_mode:
    description:
      - The minimum bandwidth mode of the switch.
      - This setting can only be configured when the switch is created.
      - Recreate the switch with C(state=absent) followed by C(state=present) to
        change this setting.
    type: str
    choices: [ None, Absolute, Weight, Default ]
  default_flow_minimum_bandwidth_absolute:
    description:
      - The default minimum bandwidth (in bytes) for a single flow.
    type: raw
  default_flow_minimum_bandwidth_weight:
    description:
      - The default minimum bandwidth weight for a single flow.
    type: int
  notes:
    description:
      - Notes associated with the virtual switch.
    type: str
  extensions:
    description:
      - A list of switch extensions to enable or disable.
    type: list
    elements: dict
    suboptions:
